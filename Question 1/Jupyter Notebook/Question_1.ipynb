    "\n",
    "2. **Data Chunking** \n",
    "- This task involves dividing the loaded documents into smaller, more manageable pieces or chunks. Chunking helps in processing large documents efficiently and can also improve the quality of embeddings by focusing on more coherent sections of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create embeddings and store in Chroma DB (vector store)** \n",
    "- This step involves generating numerical representations, or embeddings, of the document chunks using natural language processing techniques. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text. The embeddings are then stored in a vector database, referred to as Chroma DB, which facilitates efficient similarity searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Load existing Chroma DB (Optional)** \n",
    "- This optional step allows for the loading of an already existing Chroma DB. It is useful when you want to add new document embeddings to an existing database or simply utilize the previously stored embeddings for comparison without regenerating them.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Calculate embedding cost** \n",
    "- This task calculates the computational or resource cost associated with generating embeddings. It may involve tracking the time, CPU usage, or memory consumption during the embedding process. This information is crucial for optimizing the system and managing resources effectively.\n",

    "- Resource Efficiency: It consumes fewer computational resources, making it ideal for applications with limited processing power or when handling large datasets.\n",
    "- Cost Effectiveness: The smaller model reduces operational costs, particularly in environments where computational resources are billed.\n",
    "- Sufficient Accuracy: It offers adequate performance for many text similarity tasks without the need for the more nuanced understanding that larger models provide, balancing efficiency and effectiveness."

      "AI Response: India's high economic growth rate in the last decade can be attributed to several factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Economic Liberalization**: Since the 1990s, India has been progressively liberalizing its economy, reducing state control and making it easier for foreign businesses to invest and operate in India. This has spurred growth in sectors like services, IT, and manufacturing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Demographics**: India has a young population, with a median age significantly lower than that of other major economies. This demographic dividend has contributed to a growing labor force and increasing domestic consumption.\n",

      "4. **Urbanization**: Rapid urbanization has contributed to economic growth by creating new markets, increasing consumption, and attracting investment in urban infrastructure and real estate.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Government Initiatives**: Various government initiatives aimed at improving infrastructure, digitalization (Digital India), making it easier to do business (Make in India), and financial inclusion (Jan Dhan Yojana) have also played roles in stimulating economic activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)**: India has become one of the top destinations for FDI, with reforms aimed at attracting foreign investment in various sectors, including defense, railways, and insurance.\n",

      "7. **Consumption and Investment**: A growing middle class and increased investment in infrastructure have further fueled economic growth.\n",
