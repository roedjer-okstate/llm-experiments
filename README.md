# LLM Experiments Repository

Welcome to the LLM Experiments Repository! This repository contains experimental projects exploring different applications of large language models (LLMs). Below is a guide on how to navigate the experiments and utilize the resources effectively.

## Question 1: RAG with OpenAI Chatbot
- Jupyter Notebook: Navigate to [Jupyter Notebook](./Question%201/Jupyter%20Notebook/Question_1.ipynb) to interact with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model integrated with an OpenAI chatbot.
- Streamlit Application: For a more interactive experience, run the Streamlit version of the same code by navigating to [Streamlit Folder](./Question%201/Streamlit).

## Question 2: RAG with Small Finetuned LLM (GPT-2) Chatbot
- Jupyter Notebook: Explore the [Jupyter Notebook](./Question%202/Q2-QnATask-SmallLLMs.ipynb) to see how a small, fine-tuned GPT-2 model can be used as a chatbot in a RAG setting.
